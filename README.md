# Fake-ID-detection
The Fake Government ID Proof Detection System is an AI-based solution designed to detect fraudulent government-issued identity documents. It leverages image processing, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and deep learning techniques to verify the authenticity of ID proofs.

## Features
- OCR-based Text Extraction: Extracts text from the ID proof for validation.
- Forgery Detection: Identifies signs of tampering, such as image manipulation or altered text.
- Database Matching: Compares ID details with an existing database for validation.
- AI/ML-Based Analysis: Uses deep learning models to distinguish real vs. fake IDs.
- User-Friendly Interface: Allows easy upload and verification of IDs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
- MatplotLib (for visualisation)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fake-ID-Detection.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Fake-ID-Detection
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application:
   python app.py

## Usage
- Upload an image of the government-issued ID.
- The system processes the image and extracts relevant text.
- AI-based algorithms analyze the ID for any signs of forgery.
- The system provides a confidence score and classification (Real or Fake).
